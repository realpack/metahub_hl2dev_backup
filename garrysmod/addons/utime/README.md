## Requirements
Utime has no requirements.

## Installation
To install Utime, simply extract the files from the downloaded archive to your garrysmod/addons folder.
When you've done this, you should have a file structure like this:

`<garrysmod>/addons/utime/lua/autorun/sh_utime.lua`

Please note that installation is the same on dedicated servers.

You absolutely, positively have to do a full server restart after installing the files. A simple map
change will not cut it!

## Config
All client config is done in game under "utilities". To disable the welcome message, set utime_welcome to 0.
